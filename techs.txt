## Tech 1: Role-Based Constraint Prompting

Assign expert roles with specific constraints.

<template>

You are a [specific role] with [X years] experience in [domain].
Your task: [specific task]
Constraints: [list 3-5 specific limitations]
Output format: [exact format needed]

</template>
<example>

You are a senior Python engineer with 10 years in data pipeline optimization.
Your task: Build a real-time ETL pipeline for 10M records/hour
Constraints:

- Must use Apache Kafka
- Maximum 2GB memory footprint
- Sub-100ms latency
- Zero data loss tolerance
  Output format: Production-ready code with inline documentation

</example>

## Tech 2: Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)

The model generates an answer, then generates verification questions, answers them, and refines the original response.

<template>

Task: [your question]

Step 1: Provide your initial answer
Step 2: Generate 5 verification questions that would expose errors in your answer
Step 3: Answer each verification question
Step 4: Provide your final, corrected answer based on verification

</template>
<example>

Task: Explain how transformers handle long-context windows

Step 1: Provide your initial answer
Step 2: Generate 5 verification questions that would expose errors in your answer
Step 3: Answer each verification question
Step 4: Provide your final, corrected answer based on verification

</example>

## Tech 3: Few-Shot with Negative Examples

Showing the model what NOT to do is as powerful as showing what TO do.

<template>

I need you to [task]. Here are examples:

✅ GOOD Example 1: [example]
✅ GOOD Example 2: [example]

❌ BAD Example 1: [example]
Why it's bad: [reason]
❌ BAD Example 2: [example]
Why it's bad: [reason]

Now complete: [your actual task]

</template>
<example>

I need you to write cold email subject lines. Here are examples:

✅ GOOD: "Quick question about your Q4 engineering roadmap"
✅ GOOD: "Saw your post on distributed systems—thoughts on this?"

❌ BAD: "URGENT: Limited Time Offer Inside!!!"
Why it's bad: Spam trigger words, fake urgency
❌ BAD: "You won't believe what we built..."
Why it's bad: Clickbait, no context

Now write 5 subject lines for: SaaS tool that reduces cloud costs by 40%

</example>

## Tech 4: Structured Thinking Protocol

Force the model to think in layers before responding.

<template>

Before answering, complete these steps:

[UNDERSTAND]

- Restate the problem in your own words
- Identify what's actually being asked

[ANALYZE]

- Break down into sub-components
- Note any assumptions or constraints

[STRATEGIZE]

- Outline 2-3 potential approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs

[EXECUTE]

- Provide your final answer
- Explain your reasoning

Question: [your question]

</template>
<example>

Before answering, complete these steps:

[UNDERSTAND]

- Restate the problem in your own words
- Identify what's actually being asked

[ANALYZE]

- Break down into sub-components
- Note any assumptions or constraints

[STRATEGIZE]

- Outline 2-3 potential approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs

[EXECUTE]

- Provide your final answer
- Explain your reasoning

Question: Should I use microservices or monolith for a 5-person startup building a B2B SaaS with 1000 expected users in year one?

</example>

## Tech 5: Confidence-Weighted Prompting

Ask the model to rate its confidence and provide alternative answers.

<template>

Answer this question: [question]

For your answer, provide:

1. Your primary answer
2. Confidence level (0-100%)
3. Key assumptions you're making
4. What would change your answer
5. Alternative answer if you're <80% confident

</template>
<example>

Answer this question: Will Rust replace C++ in systems programming by 2030?

For your answer, provide:

1. Your primary answer
2. Confidence level (0-100%)
3. Key assumptions you're making
4. What would change your answer
5. Alternative answer if you're <80% confident

</example>

## Tech 6: Context Injection with Boundaries

Inject massive context but set clear boundaries on what matters.

<template>

[CONTEXT]
[paste your documentation, code, research paper]

[FOCUS]
Only use information from CONTEXT to answer. If the answer isn't in CONTEXT, say "Insufficient information in provided context."

[TASK]
[your specific question]

[CONSTRAINTS]

- Cite specific sections when referencing CONTEXT
- Do not use general knowledge outside CONTEXT
- If multiple interpretations exist, list all

</template>
<example>

[CONTEXT]
[paste your company's 50-page API documentation]

[FOCUS]
Only use information from CONTEXT to answer. If the answer isn't in CONTEXT, say "Insufficient information in provided context."

[TASK]
How do I implement rate limiting with retry logic for the /users endpoint?

[CONSTRAINTS]

- Cite specific sections when referencing CONTEXT
- Do not use general knowledge outside CONTEXT
- If multiple interpretations exist, list all

</example>

## Tech 7: Iterative Refinement Loop

Chain prompts to refine outputs through multiple passes.

<template>

[ITERATION 1]
Create a [draft/outline/initial version] of [task]

[ITERATION 2]
Review the above output. Identify 3 weaknesses or gaps.

[ITERATION 3]
Rewrite the output addressing all identified weaknesses.

[ITERATION 4]
Final review: Is this production-ready? If not, what's missing?

</template>
<example>

[ITERATION 1]
Create a draft sales email for reaching out to engineering VPs at Series B startups about our CI/CD optimization tool

[ITERATION 2]
Review the above output. Identify 3 weaknesses or gaps.

[ITERATION 3]
Rewrite the output addressing all identified weaknesses.

[ITERATION 4]
Final review: Is this production-ready? If not, what's missing?

</example>

## Tech 8: Constraint-First Prompting

Start with constraints before the actual task.

<template>

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):

- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]
- [constraint 3]

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):

- [preference 1]
- [preference 2]

TASK: [your actual request]

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.

</template>
<example>

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):

- Must be written in Rust
- Cannot use any external dependencies
- Must compile on stable Rust 1.75+
- Maximum binary size: 5MB

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):

- Fast compilation time
- Minimal memory allocation

TASK: Write a CLI tool that parses 10GB CSV files and outputs JSON with schema validation

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.

</example>

## Tech 9: Multi-Perspective Prompting

Use multiple viewpoints to reduce bias and improve reasoning.

<template>

Analyze [topic/problem] from these perspectives:

[PERSPECTIVE 1: Technical Feasibility]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 2: Business Impact]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 3: User Experience]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 4: Risk/Security]
[specific lens]

SYNTHESIS:
Integrate all perspectives into a final recommendation with trade-offs clearly stated.

</template>
<example>

Analyze whether we should migrate from Postgres to DynamoDB from these perspectives:

[PERSPECTIVE 1: Technical Feasibility]
Engineering complexity, timeline, data migration risks

[PERSPECTIVE 2: Business Impact]
Cost implications, team velocity, vendor lock-in

[PERSPECTIVE 3: User Experience]
Latency changes, feature implications, downtime requirements

[PERSPECTIVE 4: Risk/Security]
Data consistency guarantees, backup procedures, compliance

SYNTHESIS:
Integrate all perspectives into a final recommendation with trade-offs clearly stated.

</example>

## Tech 10: Meta-Prompting (The Nuclear Option)

Ask the AI to generate the perfect prompt for itself.

<template>

I need to accomplish: [high-level goal]

Your task:

1. Analyze what would make the PERFECT prompt for this goal
2. Consider: specificity, context, constraints, output format, examples needed
3. Write that perfect prompt
4. Then execute it and provide the output

[GOAL]: [your actual objective]

</template>
<example>

I need to accomplish: Build a Python script that scrapes Twitter threads, converts them to blog posts with proper formatting, and auto-generates SEO meta descriptions

Your task:

1. Analyze what would make the PERFECT prompt for this goal
2. Consider: specificity, context, constraints, output format, examples needed
3. Write that perfect prompt
4. Then execute it and provide the output

[GOAL]: Twitter thread to blog post converter with SEO optimization

</example>
