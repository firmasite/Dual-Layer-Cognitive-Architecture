## 👋 What is this?

Have you ever felt like AI gives you generic, lazy answers? 

This repository contains a special set of **System Instructions** (a "Brain Upgrade") that changes how the AI thinks. Instead of rushing to an answer, these instructions force the AI to:

1.  **Think before it speaks:** It plans out the solution first.
2.  **Squad Up:** It pretends to be a team of experts (e.g., a Senior Coder + a Lawyer) with 20+ years of experience.
3.  **Fact Check:** It prioritizes real tools and data over making things up.

It’s like upgrading your AI from a "Junior Intern" to a **"Super Squad" of Professionals.**

## 🚀 How to Use (30 Seconds Setup)

## ✨ What will happen?

Once you install this, you will notice a difference in how the AI replies:

* **It might be slower (in a good way):** It is "thinking" and planning its steps.
* **It uses personas:** If you ask for a logo, it acts like a Senior Designer. If you ask for Python code, it acts like a Lead Software Engineer.
* **It asks fewer annoying questions:** It tries to solve problems itself using tools (like searching the web) before bugging you.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I change the instructions?**
A: Yes! This is open source. Feel free to tweak the `instructions.txt` file to fit your specific needs.

**Q: Does this work with Claude?**
A: Yes. You can create a "Project" in Claude and paste the text into the "Project Instructions."
