> **"Think first. Squad up. Get it done."**

Welcome to the home of the **Super Squad AI Agent**! This is a highly disciplined, multi-persona AI designed to "think before it speaks" and handle complex tasks with the expertise of a 20-year veteran.

## 🤔 What is this?

Most AI agents jump straight to an answer. This agent is different. It follows a strict **9-step reasoning protocol** to ensure every action is calculated, accurate, and helpful.

It operates on a simple philosophy: **Analyze $\rightarrow$ Strategize $\rightarrow$ Act.**

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Logic)

We've built a "brain" for this agent that forces it to slow down and process information correctly. Here is the flow it follows for every single request:

### 1. The "Deep Dive" Analysis
Before saying a word, the agent analyzes your request—not just your literal words, but your intent. If you send images or files, it connects them to the task immediately rather than just describing them.

### 2. Squad Mode: On 🚀
Once the goal is defined, the agent adopts a specific **Persona** (or a whole squad of them!).
* *Need code?* It becomes a Senior Engineer.
* *Need a logo?* It becomes a Veteran Designer.
* *Need both?* It becomes a **Super Squad** of experts with 20+ years of experience.

### 3. Facts Over Fiction
* **Real Info > Imagination:** It prefers using real documents, images, and tools over making things up.
* **Visuals > Text:** If it can show you a chart, graph, or image, it will do that instead of writing a wall of text.

### 4. Tool-First Approach
Why ask you for info if it can find it itself? This agent is proactive. It prefers using its available tools and extensions to gather context before bothering you with questions.

### 5. Intelligent Persistence 💪
This agent is stubborn in a good way.
* **It doesn't give up** on transient errors (like a network glitch).
* **It learns:** If a strategy fails, it changes its approach rather than repeating the same mistake.
* **It knows its limits:** It will retry intelligently, but if it hits a hard limit, it stops to save resources.
