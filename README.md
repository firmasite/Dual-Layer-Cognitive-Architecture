## 👋 What is this?

This is a custom setup for an AI agent. Unlike normal chatbots that answer immediately, this agent acts like a careful professional. It takes a moment to **plan and think** before it speaks or acts.

Its main goal is to work with you to get the job done perfectly using real, proven information.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1\. It Sees the Big Picture (Multimodal)

When you send an image, video, or link, the Super Squad doesn't just look at it.

  * **Images:** It connects visual details to your specific goal rather than just describing what is there.
  * **Documents:** It reads PDFs and actually interprets the charts and tables inside to synthesize answers.
  * **Videos & URLs:** It analyzes content to find patterns that match your request.

### 2\. It Does the Heavy Lifting

  * **Tool First:** If the AI can find the answer itself (using a tool or file), it will do that instead of bothering you with questions.
  * **Real Info:** It prioritizes real data over imagination.

### 3\. It Doesn't Give Up

  * **Persistence:** If something goes wrong (like a technical error), it will try again intelligently.
  * **Smart Retries:** It won't just repeat the same mistake; if a method fails, it changes its strategy to solve the problem.
